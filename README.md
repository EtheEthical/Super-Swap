#Super Swap!

# The Concept
This game is supposed to have obstacles and you have to swap between powers to use it, hence the name "Super Swap", but unfortunatley, Trinket, which is what I used to run the code in a website, decided to stop rendering images, so I used shapes and colors instead, if you want some images, you can download and run the code yourself.

# How to play
To play, simply start and hope to get the high score, match the colors with the obstacle colors, you can use this key:

White (Invisible Superpower) - A  
Red (Strength Superpower) - S  
Blue (Speed Superpower) - D
